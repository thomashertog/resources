		2. Forms without labels (also: contrast!)
	6. Avoid component identity crises (e.g. autocomplete with edit and delete features)
	7. Don't make people hover to find things
* [UX accessibility with aria-label](https://dev.opera.com/articles/ux-accessibility-aria-label/)
	> Whenever you communicate anything on the web not using text, you're probably doing so inaccessibly

	* title attribute is urealiable
	* alt attribute is only available on certain elements
	* aria-label and aria-labelledby override other methods
* [Notes on client-rendered accessibility](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/06/client-rendered-accessibility/)
	* Semantics
	* Interactivity
	* Focus Management
	* Notifying the user
* [Visually assess accessibility on your website - Development & testing environment](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/)
* [What does it mean to develop accessible websites](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/develop-accessible-websites/)
* [Falling in love with forms](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015/Falling-in-love-with-forms)
	* label & field
	* label, field & note --> via __aria-describedby__
	* placeholders && HTML5 input types
	* __datalist with select (and aria-labelledby) as fallback__
		* HTML5 available --> datalist only allows <option\> as child element
		* HTML5 not available --> datalist element is ignored --> select is fallback
	* grouping in list --> screenreaders
	* multiple choice --> fieldset && legend
	* aria-labelledby works as space-separated list
	* tap-friendly hit targets by negative margins and positive paddings
	* aria-required
	* tabindex="0" (follows natural tabindex order)
	>Focus on making the form __read__ naturally and easily
	* Custom error message via JS
		* field.setCustomValidity("my custom error message")
		* easy-validation.js (jquery plugin) --> polyfill for HTML5 forms & custom validation message
	* Error summary with links to relevant fields
	* Provide field-level help
		* aria-invalid && aria-describedby
* [WCAG Principles & Guidelines](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/wcag-principles-guidelines/)

	1. **Principle 1: Perceivable** (Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive)
		* Text alternatives (alt text for images, ...)
		* Time-based media (text version of a podcast --> not a transcription --> edited version)
		* Adaptable (present equivalent content across devices and conditions)
		* Distinguishable (provide enough color contrast + offer controls)

	2. **Principle 2: Operable** (User interface components and navigation must be operable)
		* Keyboard accessible
		* Enough time (allow to set time limits for moving information)
		* Seizures (avoid potential to induce seizures in some people)
		* Navigable (help people find what they want and where they are)

	3. **Principle 3: Understandable** (Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable)
		* Readable (multiple languages and reading level)
		* Predictable (navigation label accurately identifying where it leads)
		* Input assistance (minimize the potential for errors)
	4. **Principle 4: Robust** (Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies)

		* Compatible
			* parsing (markup)
			* name, role, value (ARIA)
* [5 rules for using ARIA roles, states, and properties](http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/five-rules-aria-html/)
	1. If you can use native HTML elements and attributes to communicate the proper semantics and behavior then do so
	2. Don't change semantics, unless you really have to
	3. All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard.
	4. Don't use role="presentation" or aria-hidden="true" on a visible focusable element
	5. All interactive elements must have an accessible name

	> We can reframe accessibility in terms of what we provide, not what other people lack
* [Reframing accessibility for the web](http://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web)
	* Who are these "people with disabilities" anyway?
	* Why do we fixate on justifying the existence of people with disabilities?
	* Reframing accessibility as a technology challenge
		* Creating a test matrix for accessibility
			* [list of input devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_device)
			* [list of output devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_device)
		* Checking content against the matrix
		* Testing beyond the obvious
	* People over process, unless process enables people

##Performance

* [When it comes to delivering the best possible user experience, how fast is fast enough?](http://www.soasta.com/blog/website-monitoring-fast-enough-user-experience/)
* [10 ways to optimise images for better performance](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/10-ways-optimise-images-better-performance-71515792)
	1. Lossless optimisation with [ImageOptim for OS X](http://imageoptim.com/) or [FileOptimizer for Windows and Linux](http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer)
	2. Use correct dimensions
	3. Save for web
	4. Audit and remove images
	5. GIFs and PNGs
	6. Downsample PNGs with [ImageAlpha for OS X](http://pngmini.com/) or [PNGyu for windows](http://nukesaq88.github.io/Pngyu/)
	7. The right file format
		* animation --> lossy GIF
		* photograph --> JPEG
		* photograph with transparency --> lossy PNG
		* otherwise --> 8-bit PNG --> fall back to JPEG if unsatisfied with quality
	8. Cache-Control: no-transform
	9. CSS and SVG
	10. Progressive JPEGs
* [Fix scrolling performance with CSS will-change property](https://fourword.fourkitchens.com/article/fix-scrolling-performance-css-will-change-property)
	* background-attachment:fixed causes a paint operation on scroll
	* put background in different element (pseudo)
	* add "will-change:transform;" --> it creates a new paint layer
* [HTTP/2 - The future of the web is already here](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/http2-future-already-here-71515657)
	* Multiplexing (allowing requests and responses for multiple objects to overlap on the same connection)
	* Header compression (helping to solve the stateless nature of HTTP/1 where a browser needs to address support for a given file format or language on every request)
	* Dependencies and prioritisation (communicating to the server what objects are dependent on what other objects, and listing the priorities, the server can make certain the critical data is delivered to the browser right away.)
	* Server push (addressing round trip latency of an HTTP request and response by sending the browser an object before it is asked for)
	* And for the everyday user?
		* no one will have to change their website or applications to ensure they continue to work properly
		* if you want to benefit from performance and security features, consider some things
			* encryption (applications running over HTTP/2 are likely to experience improvements in performance over secure connections)
			* Optimising the TCP layer (applications should be designed with a TCP layer implemented to account for the switch from mulltiple TCP connections to a single long-lived one, especially when adjusting the congestion window in response to packet loss
			* undoing HTTP/1.1 best rpactices (domain sharing, image spriting, resource in-lining and concatenation)
			* Deciding what and when to push

##Web Components

###Polymer

* [Polymer for the performance obsessed](https://aerotwist.com/blog/polymer-for-the-performance-obsessed/)
	1. Inline styles and region your app
	2. Conditionally (and async) load the polyfill 
	3. Only bundle related elements
	4. Don't inline polymer into your bundles

	* Coding HTML Email can be a challenge
		* Email standards don't exist

		* Validate often
		* Sending your email
		* Content, Development and SPAM scores
	* Diving into development
		* Tools of the trade
		* Starting with a good base
		* !DOCTYPE	(include content-type + viewport)
		* Email is all about nesting tables (rowspan and colspan not supported)
		* Paragraphs or cells (inconsistent rendering of semantic tags)
		* Inline styles or stylesheets (max 1 class per element, no shorthand properties)
		* Image names and SPAM scores
		* Image size
		* Other gotchas (specify ALL widths, main container in pixels, rest can be done with percentages)
